# Awesome Label Studio Configs


A **community-driven** collection of Label Studio configs for a variety of annotation tasks—from bounding boxes on images to text classification and beyond. Our goal is to provide easy-to-use configurations that **streamline your labeling process** and **spark new ideas** in the Label Studio ecosystem.

---

## Why This Project?

- **Speed up your workflow**: Access ready-made configs for common tasks to quickly get started.
- **Learn from examples**: Explore how others set up their labeling UIs to discover best practices.
- **Community collaboration**: Share your own creative or advanced configs and help the Label Studio community grow.

We believe that by **collectively** pooling our knowledge, everyone benefits—from new learners to advanced users.

## Explore & Test

### Option 1: Label Studio Playground

Visit the [Label Studio Playground](https://labelstud.io/playground/) and **paste** any of our config files (XML or JSON) into the “Labeling config” section. Then upload or choose a sample dataset to see the config in action.

### Option 2: Local Setup

If you prefer to run Label Studio locally:

1. **Install Label Studio** (if you haven’t yet):
   ```bash
   pip install label-studio
   ```

2. **Create a new project** with your chosen config:
   ```bash
   label-studio init my-project \
     --input-path path/to/sample-data.json \
     --input-format json \
     --label-config path/to/your-config.xml
   ```

3. **Start Label Studio**:
   ```bash
   label-studio start my-project
   ```

4. Open the Label Studio UI (usually [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)) and start labeling with your config!

## Create & Share Your Own Config

When designing new label configs, consider:

- **Visual Clarity**: Make it easy for annotators to see labels/tools at a glance.
- **Practicality**: Ensure labels or tools reflect real-world needs (e.g., bounding boxes for objects, text choices for sentiment).
- **Effectiveness**: Keep it simple but powerful—don’t overload your config with unnecessary features.

A well-crafted label config can dramatically improve annotation quality and speed.
